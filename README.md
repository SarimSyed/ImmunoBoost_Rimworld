This Rimworld mod adds a pill that reduces the severity of infected wounds. You need to have the PenoxycylineProduction research completed and then it can be made with 10 raw fungus and 2 Herbal Medicine. I will try and balance the recipe in the future but I feel like this is pretty fair.

The severity is decreased by 1%-15% based on random chance thats decided when the drug is taken.
